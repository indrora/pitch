# Pitch: The new standard linear archive

pitch(1) and pitch(5) aim to replace the bad choices made in tar(1)

# pitch(5)

_Pitch version 0 is _

Pitch is a record-based, tar-like archive format with several very specific differences:

* No Octal Strings
* Compression is a feature, not a pipe
* Deduplication as an option
* Extensions defined by version.
* Whole-Archive & File integrity checking
* Append-able: cat a b > c is valid
* Unicode compliant from the start (Yes that means ðŸ’¯ Emojis are cool)
* Built for metadata included in modern filesystems (e.g. NTFS)
* Biggie Size files by default (64 Zebibytes)

## Why replace `tar(5)`?

Reading through the tar specification is a blast: 

* Two kinds of tar archives (three if you consider GNU)
* The end of the file is marked with several zero-filled records
* Extensions. `pad[12]`. `devmajor`/`devminor`. 

However, what makes Tar useful is that it's pretty much "read header, set idx=0, crank the read head".
The constant string manipulation that has to be done as well as a quadtradic extraction time 
for certain GNU tar files means that there are Many ways that the format could be imroved.

There's other reasons to drop tar. For an interesting look at what tar is like in practice, see

## What tar did right

Tar (and to a similar extent cpio) did a handful of things right:

* Fixed size blocks (tar) and straightforward design (cpio)
* Append-only record formats have their place 

## How do we replace `tar(5)`

Where tar chose fixed size records of 512 bytes (the standard tape record length and block size used on most hard drives), pitch uses 4KiB blocks. This has three main advantages:

* Records are able to handle Extremely Long filenames, 1K UTF-8 codepoints
* Modern HDDs are aligned on 4k sectors (the "4Kn" SATA standard, ca. 2010)
* Many modern processors use 4k pages in memory

4K as a block size also allows for many very useful hacks, such as short/half blocks (1,2K) and being able to hold the whole file in a single record, metadata included.

Additionally, compression should be considered free in today's age.
Modern compression algorithms (ZStandard and Brotli, in pitch's case) are reaching their theoretical maximums for certain forms of data. As such, there's no decompression tradeoff for allowing compressed segments, only a cost during compression. 
Since archival is typically a one-time operation compared to the subsequent unpacking, this tradeoff is well worth it. 

By considering compression a *built-in feature*, certain things can be improved upon:

* Dictionaries can be precomputed for a corpus and compression _extended_
* Varying types and qualities of compression can be applied to make efficient use of space.
* Certain files can be expanded to 10s of times their size (e.g. PNG art) and fit in 1/2 records.

By taking into consideration the source and host operating system, more information can be archived with less loss of fidelity (e.g. Windows SIDs).

# The pitch(5) format:

Pitch archives are comprised of *records*. Records come in two sizes:

* Full Size (4KiByte) -- The typical block size. 
* Half Size (2KiByte) -- For files smaller than 1...2 KiB. These actually take up
  the full block, but their content is the second 2KiB of the record. 


Throughout this document, the following constants will be referred to:

```c
#define BLOCK_SIZE 4096;        // Size that any block takes up
```

and the following types are declared:

```c
typedef timestamp_t int64_t    // A 64-bit timestamp, UNIX epoch, 1/s
```

Each pitch record has the same basic header structure:

* The first 5 bytes are the characters 'PITCH', no null
* The next byte is the record type
* The next two bytes (uint16_t) are flags. 
* The next 64 bytes (512 bits) are the SHA3-512 checksum of the relevant scope:
   - For archive header blocks, this is `blockcount` blocks, excluding the header.
   - For file header blocks, this is the SHA3-512 of `blockcount` blocks, *including padding zeros*.


```c
struct PITCH_RECORD {
    uint8_t   magic[5];      // PITCH
    uint8_t   record_type    // What kind of record is this?
    uint16_t   flags;        // flags
    uint8_t   checksum[64];  // SHA3-512 checksum of file or archive.
    union { 
        struct ARCHIVE_HEADER {
            uint16_t     version;       // 0, for now (All experimental archives have a 0 version)
            timestamp_t  created;       // When was this made?
            uint8_t      host[24];      // What system created this archive (UNIX, NT, etc)
            uint8_t      compression;   // what compression format is used? (0=none)
            uint64_t     blockcount     // How many 4K-blocks are there to unpack?
            uint8_t      padding[...];   // Padding to 2K
            uint8_t      prefix[1024];   // Global prefix for all files in the archive
            uint8_t      comment[1024];  // Text comment
        } archive_header
        struct {
            uint8_t      path[1024];     // Filename.
            uint64_t     blockcount;     // Number of blocks the file takes up
            uint16_t     modulo;         // Number of bytes used in the last block
            uint16_t     permissions;    // UNIX-type file permissions 
            timestamp_t  mtime;          // Timestamp that this file was modified on
            uint8_t      padding[...];   // Pad to 2K
            uint8_t      attrib[1024];   // File attributes (OS-specific)
        } file_header_full
        struct {
            uint8_t      path[768];      // filename
            uint16_t     size;           // size
            uint16_t     permissions     // UNIX-like file permissions
            timestamp_t  mtime;          // Modification Time
            uint8_t      attrib[1024]    // OS-specific attributes block
            uint8_t      padding[...];   // Padding to 2K
            uint8_t      data[2048]      // Data itself
        } file_record_mini
    }
} record;
```

record types are as thus:

```c
enum RECORD_TYPE {
    HEADER = 0,         // This is a header (at the start of an archive)
    FILE,               // This is a normal, regular file
    HARDLINK,           // This is a hardlink to a file
    SYMLINK,            // This is a symlink to a file
    DIRECTORY,          // This is a directory that should be created.
    ZDICTIONARY,        // ZStandard Dictionary 
    OS_SPECIAL = 0xFF   // This is a file that the OS knows how to make
} record_type;
```

Notable here is the lack of *UNIX-Specific* items, such as block devices, FIFOs, etc. 
We will refrain from defining too many of them here, but a UNIX system might consider
a block device an OS_SPECIAL but an NT system may have no concept of this and simply
create an empty file, or do nothing. 
Similarly, an NT system can encode NTFS Alternate Data Streams such as `foo.txt:ext:$DATA`
that encode a secondary data stream for the same file. 

1024 bytes are provided for any OS-Specific content such as ACLs, xattrs, etc. 

The header flags are as thus:

```c
enum HEADER_FLAGS {
    NONE = 0b0,
    HALF_RECORD  = 0b1,
    STREAMED_ARCHIVE = 0b10,
    NO_CHECKSUM      = 0b10,
    // other values reserved
} header_flags;
```

Compression:

```c
enum COMPRESSOR_TYPE {
    NONE = 0,
    ZSTD = 1,
    BROTLI = 2,
} compressor_type
```

host operating systems:
```c
#define HOST_OS_LINUX = "linux"
#define HOST_OS_UNIX  = "unix"
#define HOST_OS_SELINUX = "selinux"
#define HOST_OS_NT ="winnt"
#define HOST_OS_GENERIC = "universe"
#define HOST_OS_DARWIN  = "darwin"
```

## About the _Universe_ value: 

The `universe` value is presented as a generic: Archives with the "Universe" machine are treated more or less like
large file supporting tar archives with checksums. No file attribute metadata should be inferred.

## About Streamed archives

Streamed archives are special. Astute readers will notice that NO_CHECKSUM and STREAMED_ARCHIVE have the same value.
Streamed archives will not have the time to know ahead of time what the checksum of the compressed data is, how long
the archive is going to be, etc. 

Streamed archives may be comprised of precomputed file records, in which the precomputed checksum may be already known.
In these cases, an individual file record may have a checksum.
A streamed archive may be verified post-facto and have its checksums "stamped" upon it. 

## Character encoding

All filenames in Pitch are UTF-8 encoded. 

## Byte Order

All values shall be Big-Endian ("Network Order"). 

## Checksums

All checksums in version 1 of Pitch are SHA3-512.
If a checksum is all zero, it's considered "unknown" or "uncalculated".
Unkown checksums are not invalid -- they are simply considered unreliable. 
Some types, such as symlinks, have no checksum (how does one checksum a symlink?)

An archive may have its contents postfacto checked.

The checksum for a complete archive is made by skipping the first 4K (the archive header) and computing the checksum
of the remaining 
The checksum for a file's contents includes any padding used to align to 4K blocks; that is, all checks
are done against the full, padded data of the file.

## half records

With pitch archives, it is always safe to read a 4KiB block of data.
Data and headers are aligned on 4KiB offsets. When reading header blocks, the first record defines the size of headers in that block.
Occasionally, a full 4KiB will be far more than what is neccesary to hold the file. In these situations, where 2KiB
suffices, a Half Record is used. Half record filenames are limited to 768 codepoints.
